# Composite-Pipeline-Microwave-Scanner-Firmware
This robot uses microwave reflectometry to scan non-composite pipelines (plastic or any material in that catergory) for defects. The system works on the basis of a data aggregation algorithm used to cluster up reference scans into a referential data frame that will be used to classify future scans as skewed, normal, or defective. 

The reason for the three categories of classification is because of the feedback loop this system is inherently built upon. The scanner moves along a pipeline in a +/- Z direction at a variable speed controlled by a detection manager that adjusts the speed to get a higher fidelity image of the current section of the pipe. This behavior can be best explained through the following flow chart diagram:

By having a dynamic reactionary movement protocol the robot can control the quality of its data ingestion, and as result improve the system's response to future input. Given the feedback loop it would be pretty evident what kind of control system controller this firmware implements, and that is a PID controller. A PID, or proportional integral derivative controller, relies on multiple components to accomplish its primary goal which is to induce a steady-state by adding a control effect based on the accumulated historical error present in the input data stream, and by adding an anticipatory control effect by predicting the input's next trend based on the rate of change exhibited by the cumulative value of the error. The controller integrates the difference between a desired reference point, so the average of a couple scans on a clean pipe with no defects, and a measured process variable, the error-corrected input going into the system. And, the controller derives the next input value by looking at the erorr's rate of change; making the system respond ahead of time to limit residual error of the proportional component of the system whihc is SP-PV, setpoint - processs variable.
